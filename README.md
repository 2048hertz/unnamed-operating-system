# Unnamed Operating System
![unnamedos](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51583105-813d-4001-80a7-2adb34e3ff24)

A no-nonsense GNU/Linux distro based on Void Linux that runs from your USB. It drops you into the terminal, not a flashy desktop. Graphical apps? Still possible. Bash scripts handle the complicated stuff, so you can focus on doing, not debugging.
