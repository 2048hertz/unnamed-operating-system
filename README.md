# Unnamed Operating System
A no-nonsense GNU/Linux distro based on Void Linux that runs from your USB. It drops you into the terminal, not a flashy desktop. Graphical apps? Still possible. Bash scripts handle the complicated stuff, so you can focus on doing, not debugging.

This project is incomplete and more focus is being put onto another operating system being developed alongside this one, which you can visit at https://github.com/2048hertz/AdaOS
